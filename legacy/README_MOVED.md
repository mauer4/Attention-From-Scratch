# Legacy Assets

The files in this directory were superseded by the consolidated setup and download utilities. Prefer:

- `scripts/download_weights.py` instead of `legacy/download_olmo2_assets.py`
- `setup_env/*` scripts for environment provisioning
- metadata previously copied under `llm_raw/olmo_2/metadata/` now lives in `weights/olmo2/metadata/`

Legacy material is retained for reference only and is not invoked by the automated pipeline.
