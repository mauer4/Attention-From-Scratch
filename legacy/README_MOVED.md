# Legacy Assets

The files in this directory were superseded by the consolidated setup and download utilities. Prefer:

- `scripts/download_weights.py` instead of `legacy/download_olmo2_assets.py`
- `setup_env/*` scripts for environment provisioning
- snapshot assets (config, tokenizer, shards) now live under `$MODEL_WEIGHTS_ROOT/<model>/`

Legacy material is retained for reference only and is not invoked by the automated pipeline.
